# Quick and basic example of working with git

Here is the workflow I attempted to demonstrate during the Git Rganized workshop.

### 1. Create a repository on Git Hub.

#### i) Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/login "GitHub login").  

#### ii) Create a __new repository__.

Click __New repository__ from the __+__ dropdown menu on the top-right of the welcome screen next to your profile pic.

Fill in the fields of the __Create a new repository__ page.  

Choose whether you want your repos to be _public_ or _private_ (you can make private repositories public later). I recommend you click __Initialize this repository with a README__ so you won't forget to create a README later.  I also recommend you add a __.gitignore__ for the scripting language that you use. __Add a license__ to allow other people to use your work. When you're done, click the green __Create repository__ button at the bottom of the screen.
